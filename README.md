📦 SKU Management System (C Language)

A simple, file-based inventory (SKU) management system built in C. This console application allows users to manage product stock and authenticate users without a database — using only .txt files for data persistence.

🗑 Delete Product: Remove product from inventory.
📃 Display Stock: Show all products in a formatted table.
